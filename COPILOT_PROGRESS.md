## Vercel Preparation (New)
- Exported Express app for serverless environments (`server/src/app.ts`)
- Added serverless catch-all function (`server/api/[...route].ts`) using serverless-http
- Switched OCR uploads to memory storage (serverless-friendly)
- Added Vercel routing config (`/vercel.json`) and function config (`/server/vercel.json`)
- Added root `vercel-build` script to build both server and client

### Next Steps for Production on Vercel
- Replace JSON file storage with Vercel Postgres or KV (users, transactions, budgets, goals)
- Integrate Vercel Blob for receipt persistence
- Set env vars on Vercel: `JWT_SECRET`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `VITE_API_URL`
